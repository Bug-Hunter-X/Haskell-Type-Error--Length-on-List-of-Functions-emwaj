This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function `length` on a list of functions, which will lead to a type error.  The `length` function expects a list of elements of the same type, but the list contains functions with different types. 
```haskell
myFunctions :: [a -> b]
myFunctions = [(+1), (*2), length]

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print $ length myFunctions
```
